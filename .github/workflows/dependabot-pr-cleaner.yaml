# Clean up Dependabot PR text so that the git merge commits are more readable.
#
# This removes HTML markup and some content that Dependabot always includes in
# PR message bodies. The editing doesn't need to be done unless the PR will be
# merged, but it does need to be done *before* the merge so the final commit
# message is based on the edited version. We can't use the GitHub events for PRs
# getting merged or closed (because that's too late). Triggering on merge queue
# events is also problematic because those events don't have the equivalent of
# "pull_request.user", which we need for testing if the PR came from Dependabot.
# So instead, this workflow triggers when auto-merge is enabled for a PR.
